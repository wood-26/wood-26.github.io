<h1>Welcome to my recipe website!</h1>
<p>I'm Senai Habtemariam. I have this website for a Web Design project. I have two sorts of food that I can show you on this website.  They are called Shiro and Dabo Kolo. Shiro can be eaten with a food called injera. Injera could be eaten for lunch, dinner, and even breakfast. Dabo Kolo, however, can be eaten as a snack. I will show you how to make these two.</p>
