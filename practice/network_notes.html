<ul>A protocol could be like a way to do something.</ul>
<ul>A packet could be a file sent over the internet.</ul>
<ul>A header could be the "to" and "from" of a file transmitted over the internet.</ul>
<ul>A payload could be how many files a computer has.</ul>
<ul>A router could direct files in the internet.</ul>
<ul>A routing table could be a network map.</ul>
<p>Multiple problems could arise from sending files over the internet. This could include a computer having too many packets, causing it to overload, computers dropping packets since they could get mixed up, file corruption, and a file out of order.</p>
<p>We could have changed our protocols from the problems above. We a few protocols which at first was almost none, which progressed to asking others what their IP address was, to asking what their neighbor's IP addresses were, and finally passing the files one at a time. We could have started making maps from the second step.</p>
