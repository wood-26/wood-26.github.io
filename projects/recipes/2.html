<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Dabo Kolo is a snack made out of dough. Dabo means bread in Amharic. I have tried it a few months ago. During a trip to my home country, my relatives made it at home. Dabo kolo can last a long time when sealed and unsealed. But beware, the dabo kolo will get harder when unsealed. This could be a quote from my mom:</p>
<q>The food is good!</q>
