<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shiro is a food that goes on a bread called injera. It has spices in it, although one might say it is not extremely spicy. I might have found it to be tasty. Shiro is a dish from Ethiopia and possibly Eritrea that combines a powdery substance and water to make a spicy-ish wot that is eaten with injera. Wot is what goes on injera. Injera is flatbread that is eaten with wot. It can vary to light brown to dark brown in color. It can be eaten on its own, or with other wot. This could be a quote from my mom:</p>
<q>The food is good.</q>

<h2>Preperation Timing</h2>
<p>By guess, this could take thirty minutes to an hour.</p>
<h2>Serving Sizes</h2>
<p>You might be able to measure the serving sizes by water. If you use one liter of water and imagine how it could be divided with the people you want to serve, you might be able to apply that with shiro.</p>
