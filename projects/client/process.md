## ITD 110: Web Design 1

### Day 1 (January 10, 2026)

Main Ideas:

on January 10th, I met with my clients. They wanted a habesha clothing and jewelry website, with the following pages:

        * home page
        * jewelry page
        * garments page
        * "stories" page: about, founding story, and contact us
        * full collection page
        * potential product and purchase pages (not discussed)

We also had a layout for the five pages, which we made in Excalidraw.

### Day 2 (January 11, 2026)

The code was edited. See the GitHub commits for more information.

### Day 3 (January 12, 2026)

There was no Day 2 because there was too little information to mention.

Main Ideas:

On January 12th, I met with my clients again. We discussed these topics:
    
        * color of the website
        * fonts
        * any more additions
        * and more

The color was changed. I ran into an ongoing problem about the color.



We did not discuss color. The text and the images would be added later.
