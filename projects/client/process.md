## ITD 110: Web Design 1

### Day 1 (January 10, 2026)

Main Ideas:

on January 10th, I met with my clients. They wanted a habesha clothing and jewelry website, with the following pages:

        * home page
        * jewelry page
        * garments page
        * "stories" page: about, founding story, and contact us
        * full collection page
        * potential product and purchase pages (not discussed)

We also had a layout for the five pages:



We did not discuss color. The text and the images would be added later.
