<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Dabo Kolo is a snack made out of dough. Dabo means bread in Amharic. I have tried it a few months ago. During a trip to my home country, my relatives made it at home.</p>
<q>The food is good!</q>
<h2>Dabo Kolo Tips</h2>
<ul>Your hand can be a bowl for the dabo kolo since each one is so small.</ul>
<ul>Make sure the dabo kolo isn't too hard after you cook it. This is not a soft snack.</ul>
<ul>You might be able to put a spice or spices in the dabo kolo.</ul>
<h1>What You Will Need</h1>
<ul>dough (number depends on how much you want</ul>
<ul>injera cooker (or any cooker like one)</ul>
<ul>sugar (depending on how much dough you use)</ul>
<ul>1 knife (optional)</ul>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<ol>Get the dough, cut them with or without the knife, and roll them until they look like thick string. Put sugar on the dough as you do it.</ol>
<ol>Cut the strings of dough into ball-like shapes.</ol>
<ol>Put the circle-like dough into the injera cooker. Cook them until they look golden brown.</ol>
<ol>Leave the dabo kolo out for a while, with a covering, so it hardens. This might take a day or a few days.</ol>
